      <p>
        At Sand River Community Farm, we long to recover our deeply human capacity for mutually sustaining
        relationships, both human to human, and human to all that is not human. We grow and glean food
        which is offered as a gift to anyone who is hungry for any reason. Through practices of radical
        hospitality and intergenerational table fellowship, the Farm sparks a neighborly conversation about how
        we might feed one another without buying and selling food.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="giftRow">
      <p>
        Our efforts to build community across social barriers will be sustained,
        or not, by neighborly hands and dollars.
      </p>
