          <b><i>Sundays:</i></b>
          <br><br>
          <b>1pm:</b> Community Lunch! Everyone is invited and the food is served without charge. After
          lunch, we will tend to the
          garden beds: planting, weeding, harvesting, and sharing the produce.
          <p>
            <b>Where: </b>Keeseville Community Garden, across the street from
            the library and next to the hardware store.
          </p>
          <br>
          <b>2:45pm:</b> Shuttle from the Keeseville Community Garden
          (by the hardware store) to the Farm. Car ownership
          is not a barrier to attendance at Farm events.
          <br><br>
          <b>3:00pm:</b> Farm Frolic! These joyful work days allow us to continue having food to
          share. The
          farm has no paid staff; only neighborly hands. Join us in a learning or teaching/leading capacity.
          Projects
          for all abilities, indoors and out.
          <br><br>
          <b>6:00pm:</b> Sunday Supper in the Barn. A main dish of Farm Food will be served, as well
          as any
          side dishes or desserts you are inspired to bring. We will sing a song and share the Farm blessing
          before the
          meal, and share the work of cleanup, dishes, and breakdown. Each week will learn how to better share
          the labor
          of maintaining such a neighborly space, where no one is turned away due to lack of money or physical
          ability.

      <p>
        At Sand River Community Farm, we long to recover our deeply human capacity for mutually sustaining
        relationships, both human to human, and human to all that is not human. We grow and glean food
        which is offered as a gift to anyone who is hungry for any reason. Through practices of radical
        hospitality and intergenerational table fellowship, the Farm sparks a neighborly conversation about how
        we might feed one another without buying and selling food.
